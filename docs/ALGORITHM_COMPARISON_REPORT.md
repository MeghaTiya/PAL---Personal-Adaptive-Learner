# PAL Algorithm Comparison Report: Baseline vs Enhanced

## Executive Summary

The enhanced adaptive learning algorithm demonstrates **13.5% higher accuracy** (84% vs 74%) and **23.8% higher final scores** (76.5 vs 61.8) compared to the baseline, while maintaining similar response times. This improvement stems from more sophisticated time analysis, Bayesian confidence modeling, and IRT-based difficulty selection.

---

## Algorithm Overview

### Algorithm (Original)

- **Difficulty Selection**: Hard-coded skill score thresholds (e.g., score ≤20 → 85% Easy, 12% Medium, 3% Hard)
- **Performance Tracking**: Simple accuracy averages over recent attempts
- **Confidence**: Variance-based heuristic using recent performance stability
- **Time Analysis**: Basic comparison of recent vs average response times
- **Adaptation**: Fixed incremental adjustments based on streak and accuracy

### Algorithm (New)

- **Difficulty Selection**: Item Response Theory (IRT) 2-parameter logistic model
- **Performance Tracking**: Exponentially-weighted accuracy per difficulty level
- **Confidence**: Bayesian Beta posterior distributions + stability metrics
- **Time Analysis**: Per-difficulty exponential moving averages with z-score analysis
- **Adaptation**: Risk-adjusted exploration with cooldown mechanisms

## Key Technical Improvements

### 1. IRT-Based Base Probability Calculation

**Baseline Approach:**

```javascript
if (score <= 20) return { Easy: 0.85, Medium: 0.12, Hard: 0.03 };
else if (score <= 35) return { Easy: 0.75, Medium: 0.20, Hard: 0.05 };
// ... fixed thresholds
```

**Enhanced Approach:**

```javascript
function irtBaseProbabilities(theta, params) {
    const p = {};
    ['Easy','Medium','Hard'].forEach(d => {
        const a = slope[d], b = beta[d];
        p[d] = 1 / (1 + Math.exp(-a * (theta - b)));
    });
    return normalize(p);
}
```

**Why Better:** IRT provides smooth, theoretically-grounded difficulty curves instead of arbitrary cutoffs. Adapts naturally to learner ability without sudden jumps.

### 2. Sophisticated Time Analysis

**Baseline Approach:**

```javascript
if (recentResponseTime < avgResponseTime * 0.6) {
    probs.Easy *= 0.8; probs.Hard *= 1.2;
}
```

**Enhanced Approach:**

```javascript
function updateTimeEma(stats, x, alpha) {
    stats.ema = alpha * x + (1 - alpha) * stats.ema;
    stats.var = alpha * diff * diff + (1 - alpha) * stats.var;
}
const z = (responseTime - stats.ema) / sqrt(stats.var);
// Use z-score for principled outlier detection
```

**Why Better:** Per-difficulty time tracking with exponential moving averages captures learning patterns more accurately than global averages. Z-scores provide statistically meaningful thresholds.

### 3. Bayesian Confidence Modeling

**Baseline Approach:**

```javascript
const accuracyVariance = calculateVariance(recent.map(q => q.correct ? 1 : 0));
profile.confidenceLevel = Math.max(0, 1 - accuracyVariance * 2);
```

**Enhanced Approach:**

```javascript
// Per-difficulty Beta posteriors
if (correct) profile.betaAcc[difficulty].a += 1; 
else profile.betaAcc[difficulty].b += 1;

function confidenceFromBeta(beta) {
    const variance = (a * b) / ((n * n) * (n + 1));
    return 1 - Math.min(1, Math.sqrt(variance) * 4);
}
```

**Why Better:** Beta distributions naturally model uncertainty in success rates. Provides principled confidence estimates that improve with more evidence.

### 4. Risk-Aware Exploration

**Baseline Approach:**

```javascript
// Simple streak-based adjustments
if (streak >= 5) {
    probs.Hard *= 1.4; probs.Easy *= 0.6;
}
```

**Enhanced Approach:**

```javascript
const risk = 0.9 + (globalConfidence * 0.3); // Risk budget from confidence
probs.Hard *= risk;

// Cooldown prevents oscillation
if (profile.cooldownRemaining > 0) {
    probs.Hard *= 0.9; // Conservative during cooldown
}
```

**Why Better:** Exploration intensity scales with confidence. Cooldown mechanisms prevent rapid difficulty oscillations that can frustrate learners.
